- Error handling and validation

### ✅ Requirement 5: Write unit tests for advanced reporting features and data accuracy

**Implementation:**

- Comprehensive test suite with 30 tests across 2 test files:
  - `test_advanced_reporter.py`: 26 unit tests
  - `test_advanced_reporter_integration.py`: 4 integration tests

**Test Coverage:**

- **Trend Analysis Tests**: Basic functionality, insufficient data handling, date filtering, quality scoring
- **Anomaly Detection Tests**: All 5 detection algorithms, missing field identification, data quality issues
- **Dashboard Data Tests**: Data generation, enhanced statistics, performance metrics
- **Export Functionality Tests**: All 4 export formats, multiple format export, dashboard data export
- **Configuration Tests**: Custom configuration, statistics reporting, date filtering
- **Error Handling Tests**: Invalid dates, empty data, unsupported formats, missing data
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow, performance testing, data accuracy verification, anomaly detection accuracy

# Generate comprehensive analysis

trends = await reporter.generate_trend_analysis(games, days=30)
anomaly_report = await reporter.generate_anomaly_report(games)
dashboard_data = await reporter.generate_dashboard_data(games)

# Export to multiple formats

exported_files = await reporter.export_to_formats(
dashboard_data, ['json', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf'], 'output/'
)
