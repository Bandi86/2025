# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Intelligent Football Scraper System that combines web scraping capabilities with local AI processing using Gemma 3-4B model. The system will collect football data from Flashscore.com, process it intelligently using AI, and provide structured storage and analysis capabilities for historical, live, and upcoming match data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a football data analyst, I want to automatically scrape and collect football match data from Flashscore, so that I can have access to comprehensive historical and live match information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initiated THEN it SHALL successfully connect to Flashscore.com and handle JavaScript-rendered content
2. WHEN scraping historical matches THEN the system SHALL collect match results, scores, team names, dates, and match events
3. WHEN scraping live matches THEN the system SHALL update match data every 30-60 seconds with current scores and events
4. WHEN scraping upcoming fixtures THEN the system SHALL collect scheduled match information including teams, dates, and venues
5. IF a scraping request fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
6. WHEN rate limiting is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust request frequency to avoid blocking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the scraper to intelligently discover and organize football leagues and competitions, so that data collection is comprehensive and well-structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically discover available countries and leagues from Flashscore
2. WHEN a new league is discovered THEN the system SHALL create appropriate data structures and begin monitoring
3. WHEN league structures change THEN the system SHALL adapt and update its internal mappings
4. IF a league becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL log the change and continue with other leagues
5. WHEN organizing data THEN the system SHALL maintain hierarchical relationships between countries, leagues, and matches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want the system to use AI to intelligently process and enhance football data, so that I receive high-quality, analyzed information rather than raw scraped content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw match data is collected THEN the Gemma 3-4B model SHALL analyze and extract key insights
2. WHEN processing match events THEN the AI SHALL categorize events by importance and impact
3. WHEN analyzing team performance THEN the AI SHALL generate performance metrics and trends
4. WHEN detecting anomalies in data THEN the AI SHALL flag inconsistencies for review
5. IF the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with basic data processing and queue AI tasks for later
6. WHEN AI processing is complete THEN enhanced data SHALL be stored alongside raw data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular and scalable system architecture, so that I can easily maintain, extend, and deploy the football scraper system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN it SHALL use a modular architecture with separate components for scraping, AI processing, and data storage
2. WHEN adding new data sources THEN the system SHALL support plugin-based extensions
3. WHEN scaling the system THEN it SHALL support horizontal scaling through queue-based task distribution
4. WHEN maintaining the system THEN each component SHALL be independently deployable and testable
5. IF one component fails THEN other components SHALL continue operating with graceful degradation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want structured and queryable data storage, so that I can efficiently retrieve and analyze football data for various use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing match data THEN the system SHALL use a normalized database schema with proper indexing
2. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support complex queries across matches, teams, leagues, and time periods
3. WHEN storing AI-enhanced data THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between raw and processed data
4. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL provide automated backup and recovery mechanisms
5. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and attempt recovery

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and error handling, so that I can ensure reliable operation and quickly resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
2. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on scraping success rates, AI processing times, and data quality
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
4. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL automatically retry failed operations with appropriate delays
5. IF system resources are low THEN the system SHALL throttle operations and prioritize critical tasks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a football enthusiast, I want access to real-time and historical football data through APIs, so that I can build applications and perform analysis using the collected data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting data via API THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for matches, teams, leagues, and statistics
2. WHEN accessing real-time data THEN the API SHALL support WebSocket connections for live match updates
3. WHEN querying historical data THEN the API SHALL support filtering by date ranges, teams, leagues, and competitions
4. WHEN requesting AI insights THEN the API SHALL provide access to processed analytics and predictions
5. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry-after headers
