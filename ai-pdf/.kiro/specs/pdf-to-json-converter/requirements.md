# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a PDF to JSON converter that processes PDF documents through a three-step pipeline: PDF extraction to text, text analysis using Gemma AI model, and structured JSON output generation. The system is designed to be simple and focused on this core conversion workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert PDF files to text format, so that I can process the content programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file is provided to the system THEN the system SHALL extract all readable text content from the PDF
2. WHEN the PDF extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL output the text in a clean, readable format
3. IF the PDF file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN processing multi-page PDFs THEN the system SHALL preserve the text content from all pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Gemma AI to analyze the extracted text, so that I can get structured insights from the PDF content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text content is available from PDF extraction THEN the system SHALL send the text to Gemma for analysis
2. WHEN Gemma processes the text THEN the system SHALL receive structured analysis results
3. IF Gemma analysis fails THEN the system SHALL return an error message with failure details
4. WHEN the text is too long for processing THEN the system SHALL handle text chunking appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to output results in JSON format, so that I can easily integrate the data with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gemma analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL format the results as valid JSON
2. WHEN generating JSON output THEN the system SHALL include both the original text and analysis results
3. WHEN the conversion process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a structured JSON response
4. IF any step in the pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL return a JSON error response with appropriate error details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple API interface, so that I can easily integrate the PDF converter into my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a PDF file path THEN the system SHALL process it through the complete pipeline
2. WHEN the processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return the final JSON result
3. WHEN I call the converter function THEN the system SHALL handle the entire PDF → text → analysis → JSON workflow
4. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error information about which step failed and why
