- **Unknown Classification:** 309 matches (requires improvement)

### Team Recognition

- **International Teams:** 563 teams
- **Hungarian Teams:** 28 teams (NB I and others)
- **Top Leagues Represented:** English, Spanish, German, Italian, Brazilian, Japanese

### Data Quality Metrics

- **Confidence Average:** 0.84/1.00 (Good)
- **Extraction Success Rate:** 75% (Room for improvement)
- **Team Match Rate:** 100% (Excellent)
- **Duplicate Rate:** 0% (Perfect)

## üöß CURRENT CHALLENGES

### 1. PDF Processing Issues

- **Font Warnings:** Some PDFs have invalid font weights causing warnings
- **Text Layout:** Complex layouts sometimes break pattern matching
- **Timeout Issues:** Large PDFs occasionally timeout during processing

### 2. League Classification

- **Context Sensitivity:** Some matches are misclassified due to weak context signals
- **International vs Domestic:** Need better distinction between league types
- **Unknown League Rate:** ~60% of matches have "Ismeretlen Liga" classification

### 3. Date Extraction

- **Match Dates:** Currently using placeholder dates instead of actual match dates
- **Historical Accuracy:** Need to extract actual dates from PDF content
- **Future Match Scheduling:** Limited future match date extraction

## üéØ NEXT STEPS & ROADMAP

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 weeks)

1. **Improve League Detection**
   - Enhance context analysis for better league classification
   - Add more team-to-league mappings
   - Implement fuzzy matching for team names

2. **Date Extraction Enhancement**
   - Develop date extraction patterns from PDF text
   - Handle multiple date formats (Hungarian, international)
   - Link matches to actual dates instead of placeholders

3. **Scale Processing**
   - Process remaining 663 PDFs in the archive
   - Optimize batch processing for larger volumes
   - Implement better error recovery

### Medium-term Goals (Next month)

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Implement match prediction algorithms
   - Historical performance analysis
   - Team strength ratings

2. **Data Validation**
   - Cross-reference with external sports databases
   - Implement manual review interface
   - Add data correction workflows

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize regex patterns for speed
   - Implement caching for team lookups
   - Database indexing improvements

### Long-term Vision

1. **Real-time Integration**
   - Live sports data feeds
   - Automated PDF monitoring
   - Real-time prediction updates

2. **Web Dashboard**
   - Interactive data exploration
   - Prediction visualization
   - Performance monitoring

3. **ML Enhancement**
   - Advanced NLP for text extraction
