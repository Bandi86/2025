# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the existing Flashscore scraper project. The current project is a TypeScript-based web scraper that extracts football match data from Flashscore.com using Playwright. The improvements focus on enhancing TypeScript compatibility, implementing robust error handling and retry mechanisms, adding intelligent caching, improving the folder structure, and strengthening the core scraping logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to have full TypeScript compatibility with proper type safety, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is compiled THEN all TypeScript files SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN importing modules THEN all imports SHALL use proper TypeScript extensions and module resolution
3. WHEN using external libraries THEN all dependencies SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN defining interfaces THEN all data structures SHALL have comprehensive type definitions
5. IF a function parameter is used THEN it SHALL have explicit type annotations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user running the scraper, I want robust error handling and retry mechanisms, so that temporary network issues or website changes don't cause the entire scraping process to fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a selector is not found THEN the system SHALL log a warning and continue with graceful degradation
3. WHEN the browser crashes THEN the system SHALL restart the browser and resume from the last successful point
4. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent delays and retry logic
5. IF an unrecoverable error occurs THEN the system SHALL save partial results and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user scraping large datasets, I want intelligent caching mechanisms, so that I don't re-scrape data that hasn't changed and can resume interrupted scraping sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN match data is successfully scraped THEN it SHALL be cached with timestamp metadata
2. WHEN the same match is requested again THEN the system SHALL check cache validity before re-scraping
3. WHEN a scraping session is interrupted THEN the system SHALL be able to resume from the last cached state
4. WHEN cache becomes stale THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh outdated entries
5. IF cache storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation without caching but log the issue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a well-organized folder structure with clear separation of concerns, so that the code is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN business logic SHALL be separated from infrastructure concerns
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the folder structure SHALL support easy extension
3. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN the file location SHALL be intuitive based on its purpose
4. WHEN testing code THEN test files SHALL be co-located with their corresponding source files
5. IF configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be centralized and environment-specific

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the CLI, I want enhanced command-line interface with better validation and help, so that I can easily understand and use all available options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the CLI without arguments THEN it SHALL display helpful usage information
2. WHEN providing invalid arguments THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and suggestions
3. WHEN using interactive prompts THEN they SHALL include validation and error handling
4. WHEN specifying file formats THEN only supported formats SHALL be accepted
5. IF help is requested THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user monitoring scraping progress, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can track the scraping process and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping starts THEN the system SHALL log configuration and target information
2. WHEN processing matches THEN progress SHALL be displayed with meaningful metrics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN scraping completes THEN summary statistics SHALL be displayed
5. IF verbose mode is enabled THEN detailed operation logs SHALL be available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user working with scraped data, I want flexible data export options with validation, so that I can use the data in different formats and ensure data quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML) SHALL be supported
2. WHEN data is exported THEN it SHALL be validated for completeness and consistency
3. WHEN choosing export format THEN the system SHALL optimize the structure for that format
4. WHEN large datasets are exported THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized through streaming
5. IF export fails THEN partial data SHALL be preserved and the error SHALL be reported

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer extending the scraper, I want modular scraping services with plugin architecture, so that I can easily add support for new data types or websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new scrapers THEN they SHALL follow a consistent interface pattern
2. WHEN scraping different data types THEN each SHALL have its own service module
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN new plugins SHALL be discoverable and configurable
4. WHEN testing scrapers THEN each service SHALL be independently testable
5. IF a scraper fails THEN it SHALL not affect other scraping operations
