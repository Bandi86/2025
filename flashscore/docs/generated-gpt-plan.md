# ⚽ Flashscore Intelligent Scraper System

A proposal for building a modular, intelligent scraping system to collect football data from [Flashscore.com](https://www.flashscore.com), including historical, live, and upcoming matches.

---

## I. 🏗️ Proposed System Architecture

A **modular architecture** is recommended to ensure **scalability** and **maintainability**. The system should consist of the following core components:

### 1. Scraping Engine

* The central component responsible for fetching and parsing web content.
* Must support **JavaScript rendering** and dynamic content.
* Tools: `Playwright` or `Selenium`.

### 2. URL & Task Manager

* A **queue-based system** to manage scraping tasks.
* Should support:

  * URL queuing
  * Job prioritization
  * Task status tracking
* Suggested tools: `Redis`, `RabbitMQ`.

### 3. Scheduler

* Orchestrates tasks at predefined intervals:

  * Live scores: every minute
  * Upcoming matches: daily
  * Historical data: weekly
* Suggested tools: `APScheduler`, `Celery`.

### 4. Data Storage

* Stores structured data with defined schemas.
* Must support indexing, efficient querying, and normalization.

### 5. Error Handler & Logger

* Captures and logs errors:

  * Network failures
  * Page structure changes
  * Timeout and parsing issues
* Implements **retry logic** and **graceful degradation**.

## II. 🔍 Data Acquisition Strategy

Flashscore uses **client-side rendering**, meaning traditional HTML requests won't suffice.

### 1. Core Technology: Browser Automation

* Required due to JavaScript-heavy pages.
* Tasks handled by automation tools:

  * Button clicks
  * Cookie popups
  * Scroll-triggered loading
* **Recommended tools**: `Playwright` (preferred), `Selenium`.

### 2. Intelligent URL and Endpoint Discovery

#### a. League and Country Discovery

* **Entry Point**: `https://www.flashscore.com`
* Parse list of countries → extract league URLs.
* Example: `/football/england/premier-league/`

#### b. Advanced Endpoint Interception (**Highly Recommended**)

* Use developer tools to inspect **XHR/Fetch** network requests.
* Scrape JSON data directly via background API calls.
* Benefits:

  * Faster
  * More robust (less affected by visual layout changes)

### 3. Data Categories

#### a. Historical Matches

* Navigate to: `/results/`
* Scroll or interact with season selectors to extract all data.

#### b. Live Matches

* Most complex task due to real-time updates.
* **Option 1**: Poll the live page every 30–60s (simple, but resource-intensive).
* **Option 2 (Recommended)**: Intercept **WebSocket** connection and parse real-time updates.

#### c. Upcoming Fixtures

* Scrape the "Scheduled" section.
* Schedule agent to run every few hours to stay up to date.

## III. 🧱 Data Management & Storage

Use a structured database to manage the data efficiently.

### 🔢 Recommended Options:

* **Relational (PostgreSQL)**: Excellent for normalized, structured data.
* **Document-based (MongoDB)**: More flexible for rapid iteration and JSON handling.

### 🗃️ Example Schema:

#### `Leagues`

| Column     | Type |
| ---------- | ---- |
| league\_id | UUID |
| name       | TEXT |
| country    | TEXT |
| season     | TEXT |

#### `Matches`

| Column            | Type      |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| match\_id         | UUID      |
| league\_id        | FK        |
| home\_team        | TEXT      |
| away\_team        | TEXT      |
| match\_datetime   | TIMESTAMP |
| status            | TEXT      |
| final\_score      | TEXT      |
| half\_time\_score | TEXT      |
| flashscore\_url   | TEXT      |

#### `MatchEvents`

| Column       | Type |
| ------------ | ---- |
| event\_id    | UUID |
| match\_id    | FK   |
| event\_type  | TEXT |
| minute       | INT  |
| player\_name | TEXT |
| description  | TEXT |

#### `MatchStats`

| Column      | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| stat\_id    | UUID |
| match\_id   | FK   |
| stat\_name  | TEXT |
| home\_value | TEXT |
| away\_value | TEXT |

## IV. 🕒 Scheduling, Robustness, and Scalability

### Scheduling Strategy

| Task              | Frequency                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Live Updates      | Every 30–60 seconds or via WebSocket |
| Upcoming Fixtures | Every 1–3 hours                      |
| Results Archive   | Daily                                |
| League Discovery  | Weekly                               |

### Robustness & Best Practices

* **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to prevent server blocks.
* **User-Agent Header**: Set a descriptive bot identifier.
* **Retry Mechanism**: For transient network or rendering issues.
* **Proxy Rotation**: Helps distribute request load and avoid IP bans (if scraping at scale).

## ✅ Summary

This intelligent scraping system aims to provide a **resilient, scalable, and modular** pipeline for collecting football data from Flashscore, covering:

* Live, historical, and future matches
* Country and league hierarchies
* Robust error handling
* Structured data storage
* Smart scheduling and task orchestration

> The final implementation can evolve into a powerful backend for sports analytics, betting models, or football data dashboards.
