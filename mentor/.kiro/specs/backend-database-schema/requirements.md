# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on establishing a robust backend database schema and API foundation for the Bet Mentor sports betting prediction application. The backend needs to support both user management and the core sports data structure (teams, matches, statistics, and predictions) as outlined in the project plan. This includes updating the existing database schema, implementing proper API endpoints, and ensuring the user management system is fully functional and tested.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive database schema that supports both user management and sports data, so that the application can store all necessary information for sports betting predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create tables for users, teams, matches, match statistics, and predictions
2. WHEN a user table is created THEN it SHALL include id, name, email, password, and timestamps
3. WHEN a teams table is created THEN it SHALL include id, name, country, league, and timestamps
4. WHEN a matches table is created THEN it SHALL include id, match_date, home_team_id, away_team_id, home_score, away_score, status, and timestamps
5. WHEN a match_stats table is created THEN it SHALL include id, match_id, stat_name, home_value, away_value, and timestamps
6. WHEN a predictions table is created THEN it SHALL include id, match_id, model_version, predicted_outcome, probability, created_at, and timestamps
7. WHEN foreign key relationships are defined THEN they SHALL maintain referential integrity between related tables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fully functional user management API endpoints, so that user registration, authentication, and profile management work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/users/register THEN the system SHALL create a new user with hashed password
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/users/login THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return a JWT token
3. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/users/profile with valid token THEN the system SHALL return user profile information
4. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN duplicate email registration is attempted THEN the system SHALL return a conflict error
6. WHEN password hashing is implemented THEN it SHALL use bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API endpoints for sports data management, so that the system can handle teams, matches, and predictions data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/teams THEN the system SHALL return a list of all teams
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/teams THEN the system SHALL create a new team record
3. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/matches THEN the system SHALL return upcoming matches with optional filtering
4. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/matches/:id THEN the system SHALL return detailed match information
5. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/matches/history THEN the system SHALL return completed matches
6. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/stats/teams/:id THEN the system SHALL return team statistics
7. WHEN invalid IDs are provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 404 errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation throughout the API, so that the system provides clear feedback and maintains data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field information
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 unauthorized status
4. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 not found status
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 internal server error with appropriate logging
6. WHEN input validation is performed THEN it SHALL use Zod schemas for type safety

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for all API endpoints and database operations, so that the system reliability is ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL cover all controller functions
2. WHEN integration tests are written THEN they SHALL test complete API workflows
3. WHEN database tests are written THEN they SHALL verify schema creation and data operations
4. WHEN authentication tests are written THEN they SHALL verify token generation and validation
5. WHEN error handling tests are written THEN they SHALL verify proper error responses
6. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL achieve at least 80% coverage for critical paths
