I reviewed your frontend implementation focusing on the live dashboard experience and the surrounding app touchpoints that impact retention and Pro conversion. Below are actionable findings and prioritized recommendations mapped to your current code and file structure. File references are clickable in this format: [`InteractiveLiveDashboard()`](frontend/src/components/dashboard/interactive-live-dashboard.tsx:12), [`useDashboardData()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts:40), [`useAuth()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-auth.ts:38), and [`roles.ts`](frontend/src/lib/auth/roles.ts).

Summary of what you already do well
- Clean defensive coding patterns: [`InteractiveLiveDashboard()`](frontend/src/components/dashboard/interactive-live-dashboard.tsx:12) safely guards against undefined arrays and handles loading/error states. [`useDashboardData()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts:40) uses type guards, abort controllers, and memoization for stable returns.
- Clear information blocks: Stats, Live Matches, Predictions, Agents are presented in distinct sections with consistent UI components (StatCard, LiveMatchCard, etc.).
- Home page funnels: [`HomePage`](frontend/src/app/page.tsx:36) adapts CTAs by auth role and provides a demo preview to visitors.

Key issues limiting retention and Pro conversion
1) Low task-orientation for the main live view
- The default “Interactive Live Dashboard” presents generic content. It lacks quick intents (value filters) and personalization to guide users to a “What to act on now?” outcome.
- Live list is grid-based with a hard slice(0,6), which truncates discovery without pagination, virtualization, or filters that matter.

2) No differentiation for Free vs Pro in the UI
- Roles are defined but there’s no Pro/Free gating or “taste test” content in the dashboard to motivate upgrades.
- No trial urgency or inline upgrade context near the most desirable elements (e.g., top-confidence live edges).

3) Limited engagement loops
- No “Save strategy,” “Follow match,” or recap/ROI feedback to build a daily habit.
- No onboarding preference capture (favorite leagues/markets) to personalize.

4) Interpretability and trust missing
- Predictions and live signal confidence are rendered, but the “why” behind a confidence score isn’t exposed in the list. Modal uses mock details.
- No data freshness banner and no calibration/backtest surfaces that build trust.

5) Performance and perceived speed risks
- Live list likely grows; current grid with large cards can re-render frequently. No virtualization on live lists and no separation between summary vs detail data streams.
- The hook fetches all dashboard data in one request; for live use, a smaller “summary stream” should be used.

High-impact, concrete changes

A) Convert the live dashboard into a task-oriented, personalized feed
- Add a Quick Filters chip bar at the top of [`InteractiveLiveDashboard()`](frontend/src/components/dashboard/interactive-live-dashboard.tsx:71) with 4–6 preset intents:
  - “Live value (Over/Under)”
  - “Second-half momentum”
  - “Favorites underperforming”
  - “Comeback potential”
  - “My leagues”
- Persist the selected quick filter in localStorage and as part of the user profile (later), so returning users land on a meaningful default.
- Replace the hard-coded slice(0,6) with a virtualized list for performance. Keep a grid for desktop but virtualize rows using react-virtual or similar.

B) Introduce Free vs Pro gating with taste tests
- Extend role helpers in [`roles.ts`](frontend/src/lib/auth/roles.ts:21) and auth to include isPro/isFree/isTrial. Use them within [`InteractiveLiveDashboard()`](frontend/src/components/dashboard/interactive-live-dashboard.tsx:12) to:
  - Blur/lock top-confidence items for Free users with “Unlock Pro” inline CTA.
  - Optionally show delayed live data for Free (add a “2:00 delay” countdown on locked cards).
- Add an UpgradeModal and a small header ribbon CTA within the dashboard header. Trigger from locked content or header.

C) Add “Save Strategy” and “Follow match” for habit loops
- Near the Quick Filters, add a “Save Strategy” action to store current filter config as a named Strategy. Show a sidebar or top list “My Strategies,” each showing daily hit rate/ROI.
- On each LiveMatchCard, add a star icon to follow a match. Followed matches can trigger lightweight notifications or just a list grouping.

D) Explain “Why” and add micro interpretability
- On each LiveMatchCard, add a small info icon opening a popover with: the top 2–3 drivers (e.g., xG swing, SoT differential, odds drift), and a tiny sparkline for the last 10–20 minutes trend.
- Move these summary drivers into the data coming from the server/hook to avoid heavy client computation. See below for hook/API layering.

E) Improve data architecture for live performance
- Split [`useDashboardData()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts:40) into:
  - useLiveSummaryFeed(): live list with only tier-1 fields needed for list rendering (id, teams, score, minute, status, league, confidence, quick derived signals).
  - useMatchDetail(matchId): detail fetch/stream for the modal or expanded rows.
- Switch the live data to streaming (SSE/WebSocket) if available. Use diffed payloads for minimal updates. Throttle UI updates to maintain perceived smoothness.

F) Add global data freshness/status
- A small top banner that consumes /status endpoints and shows provider issues or delays.
- In the dashboard footer, replace new Date().toLocaleTimeString() with lastUpdatedAt from the hook to reflect actual data timing from [`useDashboardData()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts:24).

G) Onboarding and personalization
- Upon first visit or when profile is incomplete, show a minimal onboarding modal from home or dashboard routes to capture leagues and markets. Store locally and server-side later.
- Default “My Feed” tab that applies user preferences to the live list automatically.

Concrete, file-scoped suggestions

1) interactive-live-dashboard.tsx
- Header block: Add QuickFilters component above/beside the status filter. Replace select status-only with chips for intent filters; keep status as a secondary filter.
- List rendering: Replace the “slice(0,6)” with pagination or virtualization. For MVP, react-virtual with an estimated card size is sufficient.
- Card actions: Add Follow (star), “Why” popover, and lock overlay for Pro-only items. Make onClick open the modal; keep “Follow” click separate.
- Footer: Use [`useDashboardData()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts:24) lastUpdatedAt for accurate “Last updated” display.

2) use-dashboard-data.ts
- Provide two hooks (summary/detail). Keep the existing getAll flow for Home preview sections, but add a dedicated summary feed hook optimized for the dashboard.
- Add lastUpdatedAt and potentially a freshness metric per match for gating and banners.
- Ensure memoized selectors to minimize re-render on large lists.

3) use-auth.ts and roles.ts
- roles.ts: Add helpers like
  - isPro(role), isTrial(role), isFree(role)
  - Feature guard map: feature => allowed roles (e.g., “realtime_feed”: member+, “pro_filters”: analyst+)
- use-auth.ts: Expose trialRemainingDays (mock now, wire later). This powers urgency in CTA copy and banners.

4) app/page.tsx
- The home preview is solid. Add subtle Pro teasers:
  - Badge on cards “Pro: real-time” when visitor mode.
  - Banner text: “Live data shown is demo. Sign in for your leagues and real-time updates.”
- Keep the demo path to “/dashboard” but ensure Free sees a gated view with sample unlocks.

UX microcopy for conversion
- Locked overlay: “High-confidence signal. Unlock instant access with Pro.”
- Trial urgency: “7-day trial active, 3 days left.”
- Freshness: “Updated a moment ago” vs the static date string.

Example feature gates to implement quickly
- Free users can:
  - See only “All Matches” and “Live Only” status filters.
  - Use 1–2 quick filters with limited precision (hide confidence details).
- Pro users:
  - All quick filters, live real-time, “Why” details, follow notifications, strategy saving.
- Teaser for Free:
  - Allow 1 unlock/day of a locked high-confidence item.

Potential quick wins in code
- Replace the select filter with a Chip bar and persist last selected filter in localStorage.
- Use a compact component like a popover for “Why” with minimal content pulled from the hook to reduce reflow.
- Derive a “liveCount string” like “Live Matches (12) • updated 00:14 ago” using lastUpdatedAt.

Final prioritized backlog (2 sprint-ready weeks)
Week 1
- QuickFilters component + persisted selection + default “My Feed.”
- Virtualized list for live matches.
- Role gates + UpgradeModal + lock overlays.
- Status banner using /status endpoints.
- Hook split: useLiveSummaryFeed() and useMatchDetail().

Week 2
- Save Strategy + My Strategies panel.
- Follow Match + basic notifications settings UI.
- “Why” popover on cards with top drivers and sparkline.
- HomePage Pro teasers and Free demo clarity.
- Switch “Last updated” to hook time and add “updated xx seconds ago.”

These changes directly address return visits (personalized, fast live feed), trust (interpretability + status), and conversion (visible, contextual gating with a taste test). They are implementable incrementally atop your current code without major rewrites, especially by expanding [`InteractiveLiveDashboard()`](frontend/src/components/dashboard/interactive-live-dashboard.tsx:12), splitting [`useDashboardData()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts:40), and extending [`roles.ts`](frontend/src/lib/auth/roles.ts:1) and [`useAuth()`](frontend/src/hooks/use-auth.ts:38).
